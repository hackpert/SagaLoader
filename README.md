## Usage
1. On the first run, specify a path where the MP3 files are to be saved. (This path may be altered by deleting or editing dlpath.txt in the SagaLoader folder)

2. Enter a concise but specific query (e.g. Enter “Top of the world carpenters” for downloading “Top of the World” by The Carpenters, to avoid erroneous results.)

3. Confirm that SagaLoader is downloading the correct track, and your MP3 file will be downloaded to the location specified on the first run.
